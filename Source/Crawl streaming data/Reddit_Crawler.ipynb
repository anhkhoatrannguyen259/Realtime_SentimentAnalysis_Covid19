Also, they controlled for age and saw a similar increase infections amongst younger people who were vaccinated early as they did in older demographics and overall. \n","\n","Question is: is this just waning immunity, or does it also speak to different immunological response based on the vaccine spacing? Both the UK and Canada, two nations with notably different results in their vaccine studies, dosed Pfizer >3 weeks apart. Sometimes as much as a few months apart. It’s theorized this could lead to a stronger immunological response. Israel has a lot of people who got their second doses in December, January, February and March who are now 6+ months on from being fully vaccinated. And you can see vaccine efficacy decrease month by month. I hope we get the chance to compare the UK/Canada’s numbers once they have a larger cohort 6+ months past being full vaxxed. If their immunity doesn’t wane, like Israel’s data shows, it would be strong evidence for the superiority of the larger dose gap, instead of the on label 21 days.\n","5 - 2021-07-26 00:23:53 - The American Society of Gene Therapy [seem to consider](https://asgct.org/research/news/november-2020/covid-19-moderna-nih-vaccine) them as such. Robert Malone (one of the inventors of mRNA technology) also considers them as such. The [head of Moderna](https://z3news.com/w/playing-god-head-moderna-hacking-software-life-rewriting-genetic-code-transhumanism-101/) described them as \"rewriting the genetic code\" and \"information therapy\". He literally says that it is an operating system for your body and they are introducing new lines of code to hack the software of life.\n","\n","Anyone who has ever worked with software will tell you that release day bugs (especially for rushed development) are **inevitable** (and the greater the rush the more bugs). When Trump was President the Democrats were saying that even a late 2021 release for the vaccine would be incredibly rushed and far too dangerous. Your quotes regarding mRNA represent how it is **supposed** to work (non-toxic, stays local to injection site, anchored to cell walls, stops replicating after a few days, breaks down harmlessly within the body). The wide variety of side effects we are seeing, their very large number, and an increasing number of research papers investigating the actual impact of the injections on our body, suggest that these predictable bugs are indeed quite numerous and the vaccine does **not** work they way they ~~expected~~ hoped it would.\n","\n","It's not that mRNA is a bad idea in theory. With more careful development they might have produced a very effective and safe treatment. However, the rush of competing companies to be the first to multi-billion dollar markets severely compromised the development process and it is still to early to determine how bad, widespread and long-lasting the negative effects might be. What is inarguable is that there are many negative effects. It is unclear if the benefits (which seem to be steadily declining) outweigh this harm. It is also reasonable to assume that, were it to happen, any course correction (i.e. government and companies admitting there might be a serious problem) would be slow as it would have a huge negative impact on many people's careers and historical patterns show this to be the case.\n","6 - 2021-07-26 00:24:04 - Its a shame it has come to this. The government have handled it very badly imo. Great start by closing the boarders off but we got lucky because we do not have the same travel patterns as the rest of the world. We have been slow to order vaccine and approve any new ones. The mixed messaging around AZ has also dumbfounded and scared many people. the media has played its part too. AZ is a perfectly good vaccine which has been mass deployed in many parts of the world. We claim to be a world leader but we could not preempt what would happen if delta hit? Cmon! \n","\n","It staggers me that people believe we will get down to zero or near to zero cases and just flick between lockdowns long term. Its not a sustainable long term plan with such low vaccination rates.\n","\n","I sat down and analysed information from decent and reliable sources. I was unable to get the pfizer vaccine for another 3-4 months - and that was only if i lied on my application which everyone has resorted too. I decided to go ahead and get the AZ. I am in the 30-40 bracket.\n","7 - 2021-07-26 00:24:11 - I got the Pfizer vaccine, and had no gut issues as a result of it.\n","\n","The vaccines are all very safe. The technology has been in the works for over 20 years, and any potential side effects from it are going to be FAR less worrisome than any side effects from COVID. \n","\n","As for the delta variant, yes, some vaccinated people are getting sick. That said, the vaccine protects the vast majority of people from getting sick enough to even be symptomatic, and protects virtually all of us from getting seriously ill or needing to be hospitalized. \n","\n","Literally everyone who is hospitalized with COVID in Los Angeles County right now has not been vaccinated. \n","\n","You are VASTLY more likely to have long-term issues from this virus than you will from the vaccine.

Could be a total coincidence.\n","9 - 2021-07-26 00:24:43 - Is there any research yet published as to why these figures from US are so different to what is being seen in UK and Israel. Particular jab brand seems rather irrelevant as although Israel very dominantly Pfizer, UK is quite the mix. The difference is quite stark and should warrant some investigation but have yet to find anything. Be grateful if someone could point in the right direction\n","10 - 2021-07-26 00:25:00 - Pfizer is official and helpful, but no, you need information from literally any website that’s online that shares your beliefs. God you people are dumb. I think you got the 300 confused with the seventy percent. This outbreak had 210 vaccinated people infected.

I know I would do it on company time for a free 15min break!\n","80 - 2021-07-26 00:47:51 - So I guess the one thing you also need to factor in is how likely are you to get covid. Because if you take AZ you are 100% rolling the absolutely small risk of TTS. But with covid, firstly it’s not very common in Australia particularly outside Sydney. So for a 34 year old living in Adelaide or hell even Sydney taking reasonable precautions what is their chance of getting covid X the IFR?\n","\n","Obviously your risk of catching covid increases overtime but it has to be very small.  But I think for most (proactive) young people the choice is between getting AZ now or Pfizer in 2-3 months.   Id say for most of this group if they aren’t working in a frontline setting (perhaps retail or something not eligible for early Pfizer) then the risk of catching  is what .01% ?\n","\n","So using your numbers chances of dying from covid .00004 x .0001 = 0.00000004\n","\n","Covid death / TTS death\n",".00000004 / .00000093 = 0.043\n","\n","In other words 23x more likely to die from TTS than covid. \n","\n","So I don’t think it’s fair to say people are not rational for not wanting to take AZ if they are under 40. Those over 50 however are. And given how little AZ appears to be administered per day it seems too many are given a choice in the older aged brackets. \n","\n","Obviously it’s very difficult to know how likely you are to get covid.  From what I could see Australia has had 35k confirmed cases. Which is about 0.0014% of the population after 18 months. \n","\n","In any event the numbers are so low that I believe an individual can reasonably justify it either way.\n","81 - 2021-07-26 00:48:15 - I have compound heterozygus mthfr mutations on top of graves disease and heart issues.

Who know what’s real, there’s so much he said he said and murk surrounding the vaccine acquisition attempts.\n","83 - 2021-07-26 00:48:26 - I think due to the current outbreak there is some political blood in the water and pressure is being applied hoping to get a scalp or too.\n","\n","I key issues are:\n","\n","1. Was there an option to have orderwd Pfizer earlier as raised in the media. I am not across the details of this, and at the time the thought was AZ would be our dominant vaccine of choice and I dont know if anyone complained at the time. Hindsight certainly shows that this was the wrong call but whether or not we knew at the time we should have been more prudent requires more detailed assessment.\n","\n","2. The messaging around AZ indicating that getting vaccinated wasn't a race. Over confidence in our ability to quash Delta but not hit it hard an early is the key issue here.\n","84 - 2021-07-26 00:48:39 - aches, malaise, she had Moderna\n","85 - 2021-07-26 00:48:45 - >Flere forlater vaksinestasjonen når de får vite at de skal få Moderna\n","\n",">Bare i løpet av torsdag og fredag forlot opp mot 20 personer vaksinestasjoner i Bergen da de fikk vite hvilken vaksine de skulle få.\n","\n",">FHI sier de ikke kan garantere at man vil få tilbud om Pfizer senere, hvis man takker nei til Moderna nå.

The reason the vaccine was passed was because they were able show you were less likely to get symptomatic covid (ie less likely to have symptoms and severe affects from covid).  Some researchers believe it possibly may lessen your chance from catching asymptomic covid, but that has yet to be proven and they hope to have that information soon as to whether or not it actually reduces the chances of vaccinated people from catching and spreading asymptomatic covid.
